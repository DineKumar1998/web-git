          For millennia the teachings and the rich culture of bhakti-yoga, or
          Krishna Consciousness, had been hidden within the borders of India.
          Today, millions around the globe express their gratitude to Srila
          Prabhupada for revealing the timeless wisdom of bhakti to a world.

          Born as Abhay Charan De on{' '}
          <span className="text-purple-600">September 1, 1896,</span> in
          Calcutta, as a young man he joined Mahatma Gandhi’s civil disobedience
          movement. In <span className="text-purple-600">1922,</span> a meeting
          with the prominent scholar and spiritual leader, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
          Sarasvati, proved to be most influential on young Abhay’s future
          calling.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Srila Bhaktisiddhanta was a leader in the Gaudiya Vaishnava community,
          a monotheistic tradition within the broader Hindu culture. At their
          very first meeting, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta asked Abhay to bring the
          teachings of Lord Krishna to the English-speaking world. Deeply moved
          by his devotion and wisdom, Abhay became a disciple of Srila
          Bhaktisiddhanta in <span className="text-purple-600">1933,</span> and
          resolved to carry out his mentor’s request. Abhay, later known by the
          honorific A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, spent the next{' '}
          <span className="text-purple-600">32</span> years preparing for his
          journey west.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          In <span className="text-purple-600">1965,</span>at the age of
          sixty-nine, Srila Prabhupada begged a free passage and boarded a cargo
          ship, the Jaladhuta, to New York. The journey proved to be treacherous
          and he suffered two heart attacks aboard. After{' '}
          <span className="text-purple-600">35 </span>days at sea, he first
          arrived at a lonely Brooklyn pier with just seven dollars in Indian
          rupees and a crate of his translations of sacred Sanskrit texts.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          In New York, he faced great hardships and began his mission humbly by
          giving classes on the Bhagavad-gita in lofts on the Bowery and leading
          kirtan (traditional devotional chants) in Tompkins Square Park. His
          message of peace and goodwill resonated with many young people, some
          of whom came forward to become serious students of the Krishna-bhakti
          tradition. With the help of these students, Bhaktivedanta Swami rented
          a small storefront on New York’s Lower East Side to use as a temple.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          In <span className="text-purple-600">July of 1966,</span>{' '}
          Bhaktivedanta Swami established the International Society for Krishna
          Consciousness (ISKCON) for the purpose he stated of “checking the
          imbalance of values in the world and working for real unity and
          peace”.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          In the eleven years that followed, Srila Prabhupada circled the globe{' '}
          <span className="text-purple-600">14 times</span> on lecture tours
          spreading the teachings of Lord Krishna. Men and women from all
          backgrounds and walks of life came forward to accept his message. With
          their help, Srila Prabhupada established temples, farm communities, a
          publishing house, and educational institutions around the world. And,
          he began what has now become the world’s largest vegetarian food
          relief program, Hare Krishna Food for Life.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          With the desire to nourish the roots of Krishna consciousness in its
          home, Srila Prabhupada returned to India several times, where he
          sparked a revival in the Vaishnava tradition. In India, he opened
          dozens of temples, including large centers in the holy towns of
          Vrindavana and Mayapura.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contributions, perhaps, are his
          books. He authored over{' '}
          <span className="text-purple-600">70 volumes</span> on the Krishna
          tradition, which are highly respected by scholars for their authority,
          depth, fidelity to the tradition, and clarity. Several of his works
          are used as textbooks in numerous college courses. His writings have
          been translated into{' '}
          <span className="text-purple-600">76 languages.</span> His most
          prominent works include: Bhagavad-gita As It Is, the{' '}
          <span className="text-purple-600">30-volume</span> Srimad-Bhagavatam,
          and the <span className="text-purple-600">17-volume</span> Sri
          Caitanya-caritamrita.

          holy town of Vrindavana, surrounded by his loving disciples who carry
