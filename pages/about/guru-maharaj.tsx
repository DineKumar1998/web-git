            His Holiness Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaja appeared on this planet
            on the most auspicious day of Annada Ekadashi, on August 14, 1944,
            in New Delhi, India. Having named as Gopal Krishna at the time of
            his appearance, his spiritual master had not changed his name at the
            time of harinama initiation.

          H. H. Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaja after graduating from the
          University of Delhi studied Business Management at the Sorbonne
          University of Paris on a scholarship from the French Government and
          later, obtained a Masters Degree in Business Administration from the
          McGill University at Montreal. Meeting with His Spiritual Preceptor –
          His Divine Grace A C Bhaktivedanta Swami, Srila Prabhupada Having
          received an intimation from His grace Mahapurusa das, the then
          President, ISKCON, Montreal that His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta
          Swami, Srila Prabhupada, Founder Acarya, ISKCON shall be arriving in
          Montreal on June 1, 1968, H. H. Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaja arrived
          there on 30th May. After the kirtana, H. H. Gopal Krishna Goswami
          Maharaja enquired if he could render some service, and he was
          immediately sent to clean Srila Prabhupada’s apartment. “I was
          fortunate to receive this as my first assignment in devotional
          service”, Maharaja said. He cleaned the doors, shelves, and windows of
          Srila Prabhupada’s apartment. In this way, Gopal Krishna’s service
          attitude for Srila Prabhupada was manifested even before he actually
          met him. H. H. Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaja first met Srila
          Prabhupada in the evening of June 1st, 1968. Within the first two
          weeks of meeting Srila Prabhupada, he decided that he would accept him
          as his spiritual master. In the words of H. H. Gopal Krishna Goswami
          Maharaja, “When I first met Srila Prabhupada, the motivation to
          surrender to God was already there in me, and two weeks after meeting
          him, I knew that Lord Krishna wanted me to surrender to Srila
          Prabhupada”. In fact, around December 1967, H. H. Gopal Krishna
          Goswami Maharaja had started visiting many Hindu temples, gurudwaras,
          and churches, in his search for the Absolute Truth or God. Every
          Sunday, he would seek out a different church, temple or gurudwara, and
          would spend the whole day there. Establishment of Guru-Shisya
          sambandha Srila Prabhupada was always sympathetic and extra-merciful
          to Indians, but of all the Indians who came to hear him, young Gopal
          Krishna was very special. While all the other Indians would offer
          obeisances and sit for a few minutes, H. H. Gopal Krishna Goswami
          Maharaja was the only Indian who would come regularly and sit right
          till the end of the lecture. During the three month period that Srila
          Prabhupada stayed and lectured in Montreal, H. H. Gopal Krishna
          Goswami Maharaja spoke, “Of course, I did not know the importance of
          hearing at that time, but my only small qualification was that I was
          very respectful to Srila Prabhupada from the first day I saw him, and
          I would stay for his lectures till the end, and leave only after he
          had left the temple”. Around that time, he was working for Pepsi-Cola,
          doing Marketing Research. Srila Prabhupada started taking a great
          personal interest in him and would talk to him almost every day. Since
          then, both of them started a regular correspondence, with Srila
          Prabhupada writing as many as three long letters every month. Thus, a
          very intimate guru-shisya relationship had already begun to establish.
          On May 27th, 1969, Srila Prabhupada wrote to say, “As your name is
          already Gopal Krishna, there is no need for changing it. You will now
          be known as Gopal Krishna Das.” H.H. Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaja
          was only 25 years old then! Later on, H.H. Gopal Krishna Goswami
          Maharaja moved into the temple and engaged himself fully in the
          service of Srila Prabhupada. For many years, he acted as Srila
          Prabhupada’s personal secretary. In 1975, Srila Prabhupada sent H.H.
          Gopal Krishna Goswami to India. Srila Prabhupada made him the General
          Body Commissioner (GBC) of entire India from 1975 to 1976. Srila
          Prabhupada specifically instructed him to print and expand
          book-distribution in India. Also, Srila Prabhupada entrusted H.H.
          Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaja to oversee various important projects,
          such as Vrindavana, Hyderabad, Mayapur, and Mumbai, recognizing his
          dedicated service and mood of sincere surrender. “Srila Prabhupada was
          anxious that book-printing in India should expand”, says H. H. Gopal
          Krishna Goswami Maharaja. “During my first two years, he would press
          me again and again to print more and more books.” H.H. Gopal Krishna
          Goswami Maharaja said, “that Srila Prabhupada was especially pleased
          when he presented him copies of the First Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam
          in Hindi”. Srila Prabhupada encouraged him to utilize his talents for
          selling his books as widely as possible. “Now you can utilize your
          knowledge of marketing for Krishna’s service, idam hi pumas tapasya
          srntasya va, svistasya suktasya ca buddhi dattayo. This is the
          perfection of education.” In 1976, Srila Prabhupada appointed H. H.
          Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaja as G.B.C. for Russia. He made several
          trips to the Soviet Union, a communist state (now called the
          Commonwealth of Independent States) and risking grave dangers, he
          preached and distributed books over there. On the instruction of Srila
          Prabhupada, he took part in the International Book Fair, waging a
          virtual war against maya. Srila Prabhupada’s instructions being his
          life and soul, empowered his vision, and amazing feats began to
          manifest. After the fall of the communist regime in Soviet Union, and
          the freedom granted to religious expression, he helped to establish
          many centers in the erstwhile Soviet Union. Acceptance of Sannyasa
          Order In 1981, H. H. Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaja took the sannyasa
          order. A year later, in March 1982, on the auspicious day of
          Gaura-Purnima, H. H. Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaja became a ‘diksha’
          guru (an initiating spiritual master). Spiritual Messenger of Lord
          Caitanya H. H. Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaja being an empowered
          representative of Lord Sri Caitanya is engaged tirelessly in
          distributing Lord Gauranga’s mercy, and is one of the important
          spiritual preceptors who is fully devoted to fulfilling Lord
          Gauranga’s prophecy that “My name will be chanted in every village and
          town of the world.” Distributing the holy name to conditioned souls,
          preaching in an unfavorable environment and risky places, perfect
          management of the Society, and demonstrating exemplary behavior in
          practicing devotional service is unchecked! H. H. Gopal Krishna
          Goswami Maharaja is taking on a lot of responsibility personally, of
          delivering conditioned souls worldwide. At present, H. H. Gopal
          Krishna Goswami Maharaja is the G.B.C. for Mumbai, Northern India
          (that includes New Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Vrindavana,
          Chandigarh), Mayapur, Kenya, Canada, some states of America, and many
          parts of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Also, he is the
          Chairman and Trustee of the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, the world’s
          largest publisher and distributor of Vedic literature. H. H. Gopal
          Krishna Goswami Maharaja is engaged in inspiring and completing many
          of the largest ISKCON temples after the departure of Srila Prabhupada
          in 1977. Some of the important temple projects which have been
          completed under his untiring and dedicated efforts and directions
          include Sri Sri Radha Bankebihari temple in Nairobi in November 1994,
          Sri Sri Radha-Parthasarathi temple in New Delhi in April 1998 (also
          known as “Glory of India” project), ‘Heaven on Earth’ project in
          Mumbai in December 2003, Sri Jagannatha temple in Ludhiana on Balaram
          Jayanti, 2004, Sri Sri Radha-Govinda temple in Faridabad in 2007, Sri
          Sri Krishna-Balarama temple in (Punjabi Bagh) the western part of New
          Delhi in September 2007 and Sri Jagannatha temple in Ghaziabad in
          February 2008. The “Glory of India” project in New Delhi, inaugurated
          by Sri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister of India,
          provides a multi-media visual display, a Vedic cultural museum, and an
          open-air theater. Also, the ‘Heaven on Earth’ project in Mumbai is
          housed with modern facilities for imparting the essence of Vedic
          scriptures to spiritual seekers, a mass feeding hall, a library with a
          reading room, a Vedic samskara hall, besides a spiritually nourishing
          Govinda’s restaurant. Besides, the bhumi puja for Sri Sri
          Radha-Madana-Mohana temple in Khargar (Navi Mumbai), and Sri Sri
          Radha-Kunjabihari in Pune have also been accomplished. On June 1st,
          2008, bhumi puja and ground-breaking ceremony have taken place for the
          proposed ISKCON center, Sri Sri Radha-Gopinath and Ashta Sakhis temple
          in Ludhiana. The total land area for the proposed temple is 4.5 acre.
          The Chief Minister of the State unveiled the curtain at the plaque and
          broke ground in front of the wall with a gold-handled plow. H. H.
          Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaja also broke ground with another gold
          handled plow, to mark the beginning of construction. The Chief
          Minister lauded ISKCON’s mission of systematically propagating
          spiritual knowledge among various sections of society, and its Food
          for life and midday meal programs to feed the poor with sanctified and
          nutritious food. The project would be called the ‘Glory of Punjab’ and
          would include a multi-media visual display, a Vedic cultural museum,
          and an open-air theatre. Additional land has also been procured in
          Kurukshetra and Vrindavana for expanding preaching programs. All these
          spiritual activities are just a glimpse of H. H. Gopal Krishna Goswami
          Maharaja’s deep commitment and surrender to Srila Prabhupada, his
          untiring, dedicated efforts, his selfless compassionate nature, and
          inner conviction to spread the mission of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu
          globally. Congregational participation is being encouraged in all
          spheres, and various goals are being established. In the C.I.S., His
          Holiness has had phenomenal success! Buildings have been acquired,
          book distribution is growing rapidly, Food for Life programs have been
          introduced, weekly seminars are being conducted, restaurants are being
          developed, regular preaching programs are being conducted in schools
          and colleges, and people are becoming favorable to the movement. Thus
          Lord Krishna’s mercy is being distributed everywhere! Other projects
          include youth cultivation programs, house programs in every corner of
          the world, and overseeing the translation, printing, publishing, and
          distribution of Srila Prabhupada’s books. Under his expert
          supervision, His Holiness has taken the distribution of books to the
          highest limits in the history of ISKCON! Maharaja goes to different
          temples, before the Marathon, to inspire everyone to distribute books.
          H. H. Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaja spirited enthusiasm makes even a
          skeptic pause and contemplate on his words. His aims are so clear!
          Many are overwhelmed by his selfless and compassionate intellect, as
          they strive towards becoming virtuous people. Even the subtlest
          concepts are explained with such admirable ease and patience. Srila
          Prabhupada always admired his qualities of head and heart, and he once
          remarked, “Gopal is a very nice boy and he must be encouraged“. Even
          hardcore atheists are attracted to his graceful simplicity. Every
          encounter, every gesture, and every answer brings out the inner
          conviction he has, in the mission he has embraced. H. H. Gopal Krishna
          Goswami Maharaja ki jaya!
