          <b className="text-red-700">The Seven Purposes of ISKCON :</b>
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          To systematically propagate spiritual knowledge to society at large
          and to educate all people in the techniques of spiritual life in order
          to check the imbalance of values in life and to achieve real unity and
          peace in the world.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          To propagate a consciousness of Krishna (God), as it is revealed in
          the great scriptures of India, Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          To bring the members of the Society together with each other and
          nearer to Krishna, the prime entity, thus developing the idea within
          the members, and humanity at large, that each soul is part and parcel
          of the quality of Godhead (Krishna).
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          To teach and encourage the sankirtana movement, congregational
          chanting of the holy name of God, as revealed in the teachings of Lord
          Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          To erect for the members and for society at large a holy place of
          transcendental pastimes dedicated to the personality of Krishna.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          To bring the members closer together for the purpose of teaching a
          simpler, more natural way of life.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          With a view towards achieving the aforementioned purposes, to publish
          and distribute periodicals, magazines, books and other writings.

        <p className="text-justify">
          <b className="text-red-700">Philosophy :</b>
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          The Vedic scriptures state that spiritual life begins when one
          inquires into the nature of the absolute truth, the Supreme Godhead.
          Gaudiya Vaisnavas are monotheists and know the personality of Godhead
          as Krishna, the All-attractive. But it is also recognised that the
          Supreme has unlimited names such as Rama, Buddha, Vishnu, Jehovah,
          Allah, etc. The ultimate goal of Gaudiya Vaisnavism is to develop a
          loving relationship with the Supreme Godhead.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          To understand knowledge of self-realisation one must approach a
          genuine spiritual masterThe Vedas also tell us that the understanding
          of the self, as being non-material or spiritual by nature, is the
          preliminary stage of realisation of the absolute truth. To understand
          knowledge of self-realisation one must approach a genuine spiritual
          master, just as one learns the essence of any subject from a perfected
          practitioner.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          The congregational chanting of the maha-mantra,{' '}
          <b>
            Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama,
            Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare,
          </b>{' '}
          as promoted by Sri Caitanya, is accepted by the Vedas as the most
          effective means of self-purification in this age. The Vedas describe
          the mantra as a prayer to the Lord,{' '}
          <b>“Please Lord, engage me in Your service”.</b>
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Devotees may accept formal initiation into the chanting of the Holy
          Name vowing to abstain from intoxication, gambling, illicit sexual
          connections and the eating of meat, fish or eggs. ISKCON members
          believe indulgence in the aforementioned activities disrupts physical,
          mental and spiritual well-being, and increases anxiety and conflict in
          society. At the time of initiation devotees also agree to chant a
          prescribed number of mantras each day.

          Most ISKCON members practise Krishna consciousness in their homes and
          live and work in the general community. They also congregate in
          temples for worship.

        <p className="text-justify">
          Most temple-based members are in training, or serve as clergy engaged
          in ministerial and missionary work. Some members also help maintain
          ISKCON rural communities throughout the world.
